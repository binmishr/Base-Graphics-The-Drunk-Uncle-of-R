A Brief Introduction
=======================
As we move into the Holidays I’m reminded of the family reunions taking place the world over and how such encounters can sometimes lead to skirmishes initiated by unsolicited advice  – “Let me tell you what your problem is” or “When are you going to get a real job ?” While I can not help you navigate the troubled waters of family politics, I do sometimes see similar behavior exhibited within the Data Science community particularly as it relates to graphics packages and whether Base R conventions have a place alongside the tidyverse or if data.table is truly superior to dplyr. For practical purposes I’ll focus on R graphics packages in this post.

Whatever approach you prefer will depend on your background, what you are trying to do, in what time frame, and for whom. I won’t contribute to the ongoing and never ending “R vs Python for Data Science” battle just as I won’t claim that one graphics package is superior to all others. They all have considerable strengths. Historically, Base graphics has been there all along, followed by lattice and then ggplot2. There is also the very cool Grid package which provides powerful low level functions (used by the other packages). So my how the R family has grown. This has also led to inter-family squabbles which I feel are unnecessary.
